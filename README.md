# mussol
a Neovim plugin

The plugin is a sorter and easily find your "FIXME" or "TODO" notes in a project and make them sortable as well as create your own tags and importance? I don't know this project is in it's infancy. More of a learning Lua project with Neovim so as of right now it's nothing more than just tailord for me.
